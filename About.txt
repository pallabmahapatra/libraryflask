this is describes the present status of the project.

at present there are four url links. 
    1. @app.route("/")
       @app.route("/login")

    "/" and "/login" points to the login page.

    2. @app.route('/books/allbooks', methods = ['GET'])

        '/books/allbooks' takes us to a page, where is shows all the books in the books table.

    3. @app.route("/books/insertrecord", methods=['GET','POST'])
    
        "/books/insertrecord" points to a page, where we can insert a book.
    
    4. @app.route("/library/libraryrecord", methods=['GET','POST'])

       "/library/libraryrecord" takes us to a page where we can insert data for library_books table.

    5. @app.route("/library/bookcheckout", methods=['GET','POST']) 

        "/library/bookcheckout" takes us to a page to remove a book from library_books table.


Project  files:

main.py:
	1. this is the starting point of the project.    
	2. has all the function of handle urls.
	3. for specific urls, there are functions that are written in a different python file. 

the below specified files hold operations like create table, insert data, insert data from flask  specific to a table:

books_operations.py,library_activities.py,library_book_operations.py,library_operations.py,user_operations.py.

database.db: hold all the tables speficied in the requirement.

templates dir: holds the html templates for different kinds of operations.

requirements.txt: hold all the required packages on run this project.

Note: 

1. I have used user defined html forms because to get rid of postman. In the current stage, we shall enter our data which will get converted in python dictionary. 
2. login page is not connected to the project as more time effor will be required.
3. I have completed the first three requirement Create a book record, Create a library book record, Check-out a library book.
4. as of now, there few weak points in the, which needs to be addressed, like: what is table is not present, what is query is not executed etc.
5. coming tables: all the tables are designed as per given requirements.
